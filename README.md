# ResNet34-10-Animal-Images-Classifying
The objective of this project is to develop and assess a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with the capability to accurately classify images belonging to 10 distinct animal species.  
    
Utilizing the Animals-10 dataset, which comprises a wide array of images with varying dimensions, our model integrates techniques including the ResNet-34 architecture, data augmentation, class weighting, early stopping, and a learning rate scheduler. These methodologies are employed to effectively tackle challenges such as class imbalance and overfitting, thus enhancing the model's performance and generalization ability. The final validation accuracy reached to about 90%.
